### Features of Utter Disorder

* **Bouncing DVD:** The classic. Watch in awe as a low-resolution "DVD" logo relentlessly bounces around the screen, changing color every time it hits a wall. Just like the good old days.
* **Confetti Cannon:** An endless celebration for... absolutely nothing. Your screen will erupt in a shower of vibrant, animated confetti. Because every moment is a party, even when you're staring at an empty shopping cart.
* **Snowfall:** Turn your webpage into a winter wonderland. Tiny, pixelated snowflakes gently (or not so gently, depending on your chaos level) drift down the screen. Perfect for getting into the holiday spirit in the middle of summer.
* **Emoji Storm:** A relentless barrage of random emojis rains down from the top of your screen. From dancing ladies to pizza slices and flames, this is a visual symphony of internet culture at its most chaotic.
* **Cursor Follower:** A tiny, menacing skull follows your cursor around the page. A constant, slightly unsettling reminder that even your mouse movements are under scrutiny. It's not creepy, it's... *motivational*.
